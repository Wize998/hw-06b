# Triangle Classification â€“ HW-06b

Small Python project for testing and fixing a buggy `classifyTriangle()` implementation.

## Objectives
- Develop a robust unit test suite for `classifyTriangle(a,b,c)`.
- Run tests against the **initial (buggy)** implementation and record results.
- Fix logic defects in `Triangle.py`, re-run the **same** tests, and record results.
